üß© Project Description:
You‚Äôll build a Python program that automatically renames multiple files in a chosen folder, following a consistent pattern.
For example, if you have these files:

photo1.png
photo2.png
photo3.png


You can rename them automatically to:
Vacation_1.png
Vacation_2.png
Vacation_3.png


This is a real-world automation task ‚Äî useful for organizing photo collections, downloaded files, or datasets.

üõ†Ô∏è Requirements:
Ask the user for a folder path (or default to ‚ÄúDownloads‚Äù).
Ask the user for a base name (e.g., ‚ÄúVacation‚Äù, ‚ÄúProject‚Äù, etc.).
Loop through all files in that folder.
Rename each file using this format: base_name + sequential_number + original_extension

Example: Vacation_1.jpg, Vacation_2.jpg, Vacation_3.jpg
If a file with the new name already exists, skip it and show a message.
Print a summary at the end:

15 files renamed successfully.
2 files skipped (already existed).

üí° Bonus Challenge (Optional):
Let the user choose whether to rename all files or only files of a specific type (like only .jpg or .mp3).
Add an undo feature by saving the old and new file names in a .txt log file.
